# filename_randomizer
This is a small python program to randomize the names of all of the files in a directory.

I made it because there are times when I'd like to randomize the names of all the files in an image folder or sometimes I just want to randomize one file to avoid a conflict.

Be very careful when using it because it is definitely possible to mess things up with this program.

Also note that it will not randomize any files with multiple '.' characters in their names.
