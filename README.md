# filename_randomizer
This is a small python program to randomize the names of the files in a directory.

I made it because there are times when I'd like to randomize the names of all the files in an image folder or sometimes I just want to randomize one file to avoid a conflict.

Filenames will be randomized using the lowercase alphabet a-z, uppercase alphabet A-Z, and numbers 0-9. 
The length of the new filename will be 30 to 60 characters + the extension.

Be very careful when using it because it is definitely possible to mess things up with this program.

Also note that it will not randomize any files with multiple '.' characters in their names.
